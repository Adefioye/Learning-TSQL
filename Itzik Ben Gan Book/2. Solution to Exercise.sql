/*
Explain the difference between the following two queries:
*/

-- Query 1

-- The below query returns num_of_orders processed by each employee on 1st may, 2015.

SELECT empid, COUNT(*) AS numorders
FROM Sales.Orders
WHERE orderdate < '20160501'
GROUP BY empid;

-- Query 2

--The below query returns num_of_orders processed by each employee before 1st may, 2015.

SELECT empid, COUNT(*) AS numorders
FROM Sales.Orders
GROUP BY empid
HAVING MAX(orderdate) < '20160501';
