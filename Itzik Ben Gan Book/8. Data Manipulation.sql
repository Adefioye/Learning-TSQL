	INSERT SELECT

THis inserts a set of rows returned by a SELECT query into a traget table. It is important
to note that the rule about default constraint and column nullability explained before applies
to the INSERT SELECT statement.

Also, if any row fails to enter the table, none of the rows enters thne table.

NOTE: If you include a system function such as SYSDATETIME in the inserted query, the
function gets invoked only once for the entire query and not once per row. The
exception to this rule is if you generate globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) using the
NEWID function, which gets invoked per row.

/*
	INSERT EXEC

/*
	SELECT INTO statement

This is a non-standard T-SQL statement that creates a target table and populates it with data.
This statement cannot be used to insert data into an existing table.

NOTE: The target table’s structure and data are based on the source table. The SELECT INTO
statement copies from the source the base structure (such as column names, types, nullability,
and identity property) and the data. It does not copy from the source constraints, indexes,
triggers, column properties such as SPARSE and FILESTREAM, and permissions. If you need
those in the target, you’ll need to create them yourself.

SELECT orderid, orderdate, empid, custid
INTO dbo.Orders
FROM Sales.Orders;


-- If you need to use a SELECT INTO statement with set operations, you specify the INTO

-- SELECT INTO statement creates a table called Locations and populates it with the result of an

/*
	BULK INSERT statement

The BULK INSERT statement is used to insert into an existing table data originating from a
file. In the statement, you specify the target table, the source file, and options. You can specify
many options, including the data file type (for example, char or native), the field terminator,
the row terminator, and others—all of which are fully documented.

*/

-- The following code bulk inserts the contents of the file c:\temp\orders.txt into
-- the table dbo.Orders, specifying that the data file type is char, the field terminator is a comma,
-- and the row terminator is the newline character:

	WITH
		(
			DATAFILETYPE = 'char',
			FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
			ROWTERMINATOR = '\n'

/*
	IDENTITY PROPERTY and SEQUENCE OBJECT

SQL Server supports 2 built-in solutions to automatically generate numeric keys. These are
the IDENTITY PROPERTY and SEQUENCE OBJECT. The identity works well for some scenarios but has
many limitations. The sequence object helps to resolve many of identity's limitations.

Identity is a standard column property. You can define this property for a column with any
numeric type with a scale of zero (no fraction). When defining the property, you can
optionally specify a seed (the first value) and an increment (a step value). If you don’t provide
those, the default is 1 for both. You typically use this property to generate surrogate keys,
which are keys that are produced by the system and are not derived from the application data.

NOTE: In INSERT statement, the IDENTITY column must be ignored

@@identity and SCOPE_IDENTITY are used to get last value of identity generated in the current
session. Therefore, they both do not account for inserts done in other session.

To be able to get the last identity value in the table regardless of session, the
IDENT_CURRENT function is used.

SQL Server uses performance cache for the IDENTITY property, which can result in gaps between the 
keys when there's an unclean termination of the SQL Server(for example, power failure ). Hence,
teh IDENTITY property should be used when we wanna allow gaps between the keys. 

We can use IDENTITY_INSERT to specify our own explicit values for the identity column.
Unfortunately, there is no way to update the values of the rows if and when necessary.

(
	keycol  INT			NOT NULL	IDENTITY(1, 1)
		CONSTRAINT PK_T1 PRIMARY KEY,
	datacol VARCHAR(10)	NOT NULL CHECK(datacol LIKE '[ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]%')
);

-- The table also contains a character string column called datacol, whose data is 
-- restricted with a CHECK constraint to strings starting with an alphabetical character.

-- Identity column ignored

INSERT INTO dbo.T1(datacol) VALUES('AAAAA'),('CCCCC'),('BBBBB');

SELECT * FROM dbo.T1;

-- The generic $identity word can be used to return the identity column

SELECT $identity FROM dbo.T1;

-- the following code inserts a new row into the table T1, obtains the newly
-- generated identity value and places it into a variable by querying the SCOPE_IDENTITY
-- function, and queries the variable:

DECLARE @new_key AS INT;

INSERT INTO dbo.T1(datacol) VALUES('AAAAA');

SET @new_key = SCOPE_IDENTITY()

SELECT @new_key AS new_key;

-- Using IDENT_FUNCTION to get the last identity value in table regardless of session

SELECT 
	SCOPE_IDENTITY() AS [SCOPE_IDENTITY],
	@@IDENTITY AS '@@IDENTITY',
	IDENT_CURRENT('dbo.T1') AS 'IDENT_FUNCTION';

-- Run the following INSERT which conflicts with the CHECK constraint

INSERT INTO dbo.T1(datacol) VALUES('12345');

-- Lets check the IDENTITY functions. It was shockingly observed that IDENT_FUNCTION reflects
-- the increase of the current identity value from 5 to 6 in spite of the failure of the 
-- INSERT statement due to its conflict with the CHECK constraint on that column.

SELECT 
	SCOPE_IDENTITY() AS [SCOPE_IDENTITY],
	@@IDENTITY AS '@@IDENTITY',
	IDENT_CURRENT('dbo.T1') AS 'IDENT_FUNCTION';

-- Let us do another insert

INSERT INTO dbo.T1(datacol) VALUES('EEEEE');

-- The query below shows a gap in keycol from 5 to 7

SELECT * FROM dbo.T1;

-- The following shows us how to insert a row into T1 with an explicit 5 on the keycol

 SET IDENTITY_INSERT dbo.T1 ON;
 INSERT INTO dbo.T1(keycol, datacol) VALUES(6, 'FFFFFF');
 SET IDENTITY_INSERT dbo.T1 OFF;

 

 /*
	SEQUENCE OBJECT
	
This serves as an alternative to IDENTITY property. It is not tied to one column rather it is
an ondependent object that can be applied to more than 1 column in the table.Whenever a new
value is to be generated, you invoke a function on the object and then returns a value to be 
used wherever you like.

To create a sequence object, we use CREATE SEQUENCE AS <specify-datatype>. If the datatype is 
not passed, BIGINT is assumed by default. It is also supported by MINVALUE<val>, MAXVALUE<val>,
START WITH <val>, INCREMENT BY <val>.

ITs a must to specify TYPE, MINVALUE and CYCLE. Others can be set as defaults.

The sequence object also supports a caching option (CACHE <val> | NO CACHE) that tells
SQL Server how often to write the recoverable value to disk. For example, if you specify a
cache value of 10,000, SQL Server will write to disk every 10,000 requests, and in between
disk writes, it will maintain the current value and how many values are left in memory.

You can change any of the sequence properties except the data type with the ALTER
SEQUENCE command (MINVAL <val>, MAXVAL <val>, RESTART WITH <val>,
INCREMENT BY <val>, CYCLE | NO CYCLE, or CACHE <val> | NO CACHE).

 
*/

-- For example, suppose you want to create a sequence that will help you generate order IDs.
-- You want it to be of an INT type, have a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value that is the
-- maximum supported by the type, start with 1, increment by 1, and allow cycling. Here’s the
-- CREATE SEQUENCE command you would use to create such a sequence:

CREATE SEQUENCE dbo.SeqOrderIDs AS INT
	MINVALUE 1
	CYCLE;

-- We can prevent dbo.SeqOrderIDs from cycling by using the ALTER SEQUENCE command.

ALTER SEQUENCE dbo.SeqOrderIDs
	NO CYCLE;

-- To generate a new sequence value, you need to invoke the standard function 
-- NEXT VALUE FOR <sequence name>

SELECT NEXT VALUE FOR dbo.SeqOrderIDs;

-- Notice that unlike IDENTITY property. there is no need to insert a row into a table in
-- order to generate a new value.

-- Some applications need to generate the new value before using it. With sequences, you can
-- store the result of the function in a variable and use it later in the code. To
-- demonstrate this, first create a table called T1 with the following code:

IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.T1', 'U') IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE dbo.T1;

CREATE TABLE dbo.T1
(
	keycol  INT			NOT NULL
		CONSTRAINT PK_T1 PRIMARY KEY,
	datacol VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
);

-- The following code generates a sequence value, stores it in a variable, and then uses
-- the variable in an INSERT statement to insert a row into the table:

DECLARE @neworderid AS INT = NEXT VALUE FOR dbo.SeqOrderIDs;
INSERT INTO dbo.T1(keycol, datacol) VALUES(@neworderid, 'a'); 

SELECT * FROM dbo.T1;
