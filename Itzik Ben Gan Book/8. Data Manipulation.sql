/*
	IDENTITY PROPERTY and SEQUENCE OBJECT

SQL Server supports 2 built-in solutions to automatically generate numeric keys. These are
the IDENTITY PROPERTY and SEQUENCE OBJECT. The identity works well for some scenarios but has
many limitations. The sequence object helps to resolve many of identity's limitations.

Identity is a standard column property. You can define this property for a column with any
numeric type with a scale of zero (no fraction). When defining the property, you can
optionally specify a seed (the first value) and an increment (a step value). If you don’t provide
those, the default is 1 for both. You typically use this property to generate surrogate keys,
which are keys that are produced by the system and are not derived from the application data.

NOTE: In INSERT statement, the IDENTITY column must be ignored

@@identity and SCOPE_IDENTITY are used to get last value of identity generated in the current
session. Therefore, they both do not account for inserts done in other session.

To be able to get the last identity value in the table regardless of session, the
IDENT_CURRENT function is used.

SQL Server uses performance cache for the IDENTITY property, which can result in gaps between the 
keys when there's an unclean termination of the SQL Server(for example, power failure ). Hence,
teh IDENTITY property should be used when we wanna allow gaps between the keys. 

We can use IDENTITY_INSERT to specify our own explicit values for the identity column.
Unfortunately, there is no way to update the values of the rows if and when necessary.

-- Run the following INSERT which conflicts with the CHECK constraint

-- the increase of the current identity value from 5 to 6 in spite of the failure of the 
-- INSERT statement due to its conflict with the CHECK constraint on that column.

	SCOPE_IDENTITY() AS [SCOPE_IDENTITY],
	@@IDENTITY AS '@@IDENTITY',

 SET IDENTITY_INSERT dbo.T1 ON;
 INSERT INTO dbo.T1(keycol, datacol) VALUES(6, 'FFFFFF');
 SET IDENTITY_INSERT dbo.T1 OFF;

 

 /*
	SEQUENCE OBJECT
	
This serves as an alternative to IDENTITY property. It is not tied to one column rather it is
an ondependent object that can be applied to more than 1 column in the table.Whenever a new
value is to be generated, you invoke a function on the object and then returns a value to be 
used wherever you like.

To create a sequence object, we use CREATE SEQUENCE AS <specify-datatype>. If the datatype is 
not passed, BIGINT is assumed by default. It is also supported by MINVALUE<val>, MAXVALUE<val>,
START WITH <val>, INCREMENT BY <val>.

ITs a must to specify TYPE, MINVALUE and CYCLE. Others can be set as defaults.

The sequence object also supports a caching option (CACHE <val> | NO CACHE) that tells
SQL Server how often to write the recoverable value to disk. For example, if you specify a
cache value of 10,000, SQL Server will write to disk every 10,000 requests, and in between
disk writes, it will maintain the current value and how many values are left in memory.

You can change any of the sequence properties except the data type with the ALTER
SEQUENCE command (MINVAL <val>, MAXVAL <val>, RESTART WITH <val>,
INCREMENT BY <val>, CYCLE | NO CYCLE, or CACHE <val> | NO CACHE).

 
*/

-- For example, suppose you want to create a sequence that will help you generate order IDs.
-- You want it to be of an INT type, have a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value that is the
-- maximum supported by the type, start with 1, increment by 1, and allow cycling. Here’s the
-- CREATE SEQUENCE command you would use to create such a sequence:

CREATE SEQUENCE dbo.SeqOrderIDs AS INT
	MINVALUE 1
	CYCLE;

-- We can prevent dbo.SeqOrderIDs from cycling by using the ALTER SEQUENCE command.

ALTER SEQUENCE dbo.SeqOrderIDs
	NO CYCLE;

-- To generate a new sequence value, you need to invoke the standard function 
-- NEXT VALUE FOR <sequence name>

SELECT NEXT VALUE FOR dbo.SeqOrderIDs;

-- Notice that unlike IDENTITY property. there is no need to insert a row into a table in
-- order to generate a new value.

-- Some applications need to generate the new value before using it. With sequences, you can
-- store the result of the function in a variable and use it later in the code. To
-- demonstrate this, first create a table called T1 with the following code:

IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.T1', 'U') IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE dbo.T1;

CREATE TABLE dbo.T1
(
	keycol  INT			NOT NULL
		CONSTRAINT PK_T1 PRIMARY KEY,
	datacol VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
);

-- The following code generates a sequence value, stores it in a variable, and then uses
-- the variable in an INSERT statement to insert a row into the table:

DECLARE @neworderid AS INT = NEXT VALUE FOR dbo.SeqOrderIDs;
INSERT INTO dbo.T1(keycol, datacol) VALUES(@neworderid, 'a'); 

SELECT * FROM dbo.T1;

-- We can also just specify NEXT VALUE FOR function as part of our INSERT statement

INSERT INTO dbo.T1(keycol, datacol) VALUES(NEXT VALUE FOR dbo.SeqOrderIDs, 'b');

SELECT * FROM dbo.T1;

-- Unlike identity, we can generate new sequence values in an UPDATE statement

UPDATE dbo.T1 
	SET keycol = NEXT VALUE FOR dbo.SeqOrderIDs;

SELECT * FROM dbo.T1;

-- To get information about our sequence, query a view called sys.sequences. For example, to
-- find the current sequence value in the SeqOrderIDs sequence, you use the following code:

SELECT current_value
FROM sys.sequences
WHERE OBJECT_ID = OBJECT_ID('dbo.SeqOrderIDs');

-- SQL Server also allows for the control of the order of the assigned sequence values in a 
-- multirow insert by using an OVER clause

INSERT INTO dbo.T1(keycol, datacol)
	SELECT 
		NEXT VALUE FOR dbo.SeqORderIDs OVER(ORDER BY hiredate),
		LEFT(firstname, 1) + LEFT(lastname, 1)
	FROM HR.Employees;

SELECT * FROM dbo.T1;

-- Another extension to the standard allows the use of the NEXT VALUE FOR function in a 
-- default constraint

ALTER TABLE dbo.T1
	ADD CONSTRAINT DFT_T1_keycol
		DEFAULT (NEXT VALUE FOR SeqOrderIDs) FOR keycol;

-- Let us insert new row, this time we don't have to indicate a value for keycol

INSERT INTO dbo.T1(datacol) VALUES('c');

SELECT * FROM dbo.T1;

/*Unlike with identity, which you cannot add to or remove from an existing column, you can
add or remove a default constraint. The preceding example showed how to add a default
constraint to a table and associate it with a column. To remove a constraint, use the syntax:
ALTER TABLE <table_name> DROP CONSTRAINT <constraint_name>

There’s another extension to the standard you can use to allocate a whole range of sequence
values at once by using a stored procedure called sp_sequence_get_range. The idea is that
it is efficient to update a range of sequence at once whenan application needs one.

SQL_VARIANT is a generic data type that can hold within it various base data types. The
sp_sequence_get_range procedure uses this type for several of its parameters,
including the output parameter @range_first_value.

Note that like with identity, the sequence object does not guarantee you will have no gaps. If
a new sequence value was generated by a transaction that failed or intentionally rolled back,
the sequence change is not undone. Also, as mentioned earlier with identity, sequence objects
support a performance cache feature, which can result in gaps when there’s an unclean
termination of the SQL Server process.
*/

DECLARE @first AS SQL_VARIANT;

EXEC sys.sp_sequence_get_range
	@sequence_name = 'dbo.SeqOrderIDs',
	@range_size = 1000000,
	@range_first_value = @first OUTPUT;

/*
 DELETING DATA

There are 2 statements for deleting rows from a table: DELETE and TRUNCATE.

DELETE statement deletes data from a table based on optional filter predicate. DELETE statement
is usually expensive when large numbe rof rows is deleted bacuse it is a fully logged operation.

TRUNCATE statement deletes a whole table and it is minimally logged. For performance difference,
when deleting table with millions of rows, itis better to use TRUNCATE.

TRUNCATE and DELETE also have a functional difference when the table has an identity
column. TRUNCATE resets the identity value back to the original seed, but DELETE doesn’t.

TRUNCATE is not allowed when the table has a foreign key. It can only be allowed only when 
the foreign reference has been dropped using ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT. It can be re-created
using ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT.

SQL Server 2016 enhances the TRUNCATE statement by supporting the truncation of individual partitions. You can specify a
list of partitions and partition ranges (with the keyword TO between the range delimiters). As

Table partitioning is about dividing your table into multiple units called partitions,
mainly for manageability purposes. This allows handling processes like importing data
into the table and purging historic data to be handled more efficiently.

NOTE: T-SQL supports a nonstandard DELETE syntax based on joins. This means we can delete
rows from a table based on filter against attributes in related rows from another table.

/*
	MODIFYING DATA through TABLE EXPRESSIONS

T-SQL doesn't limit actions against table expressions to SELECT only. it also allows other
DML statements(INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and MERGE) against those. 

	Modifying data through table expressions has a few restrictions:

--> If the query defining the table expression joins tables, you're allowed to affect 
allow one side of the join, not both, in then same modification statement.

--> You cannot update a column that is a result of a calculation; SQL Server doesn't try
to reverse-engineer the values.

--> INSERT statements must specify values for any columns in the underlying table that do
not get their values implicitly. Examples for cases where a column can get a value
implicitly include a column that allows NULLs, has a default value, has an identity
property, or is typed as ROWVERSION.

*/

-- Onne of the most powerful use cases for using table expressions to modify data is for 
-- toubleshooting and debugging purposes.

UPDATE OD
	SET discount += 0.05
FROM dbo.OrderDetails AS OD INNER JOIN dbo.Orders AS O
	ON OD.orderid = O.orderid
WHERE O.custid = 1;

-- Table expressions can be used for to update as shown below usng CTEs

WITH C AS
(
	SELECT custid, OD.orderid, productid, discount, discount + 0.05 AS newdiscount
	FROM dbo.OrderDetails AS OD INNER JOIN dbo.Orders AS O
		ON OD.orderid = O.orderid
	WHERE O.custid = 1
)
UPDATE C
	SET discount = newdiscount;

SELECT OD.* FROM dbo.OrderDetails AS OD INNER JOIN dbo.Orders AS O
		ON OD.orderid = O.orderid
	WHERE O.custid = 1;

-- THE above can also be implemented using a derived table as shown

UPDATE D
	SET discount = newdiscount
FROM (
	SELECT custid, OD.orderid, productid, discount, discount + 0.05 AS newdiscount
	FROM dbo.OrderDetails AS OD INNER JOIN dbo.Orders AS O
		ON OD.orderid = O.orderid
	WHERE O.custid = 1
) AS D;

SELECT OD.* FROM dbo.OrderDetails AS OD INNER JOIN dbo.Orders AS O
		ON OD.orderid = O.orderid
	WHERE O.custid = 1;

-- Using table expression makes troubleshooting easy. However, sometimes, it is the only
-- option.

IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.T1', 'U') IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE dbo.T1;

CREATE TABLE dbo.T1(col1 INT, col2 INT);
GO

INSERT INTO dbo.T1(col1) VALUES(20), (10), (30);

SELECT * FROM dbo.T1;

-- Let us try update col2 with the result of a ROW_NUMBER function. The problem is that 
-- ROW_NUMBER is not allowed in the SET clause of an UPDATE statement.It is only allowed in
-- in the SELECT clause. Try running the following code.

UPDATE dbo.T1
	SET col2 = ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY col1);

-- To get around this, we use a table expression

WITH C AS
(
	SELECT col1, col2, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY col1) AS rownum
	FROM dbo.T1
)
UPDATE C
	SET col2 = rownum;

-- Query the result of the update

SELECT * FROM dbo.T1;

/*
	Modifications with TOP and OFFSETFETCH

T-SQL supports using TOP option in INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and MERGE statements. When the TOP 
option is used, SQL Server would stop processing modification when the number(percentage) of
rows specified has been modified.

Unfortunately, ORDER BY clause is not allowed in DML statements. Essentially, whichever rows
SQL Server has access first will be modified.

The OFFSET-FETCH filter is not allowed directly in modifications because this filter
requires an ORDER BY clause and modification statements don’t support one.

WITH C AS

-- Alternatively, we could use OFFSET-FETCH

/*
	OUTPUT clause

This helps to return info from the modified rows for trouble-shooting, auditing and archiving.
In this clause, we specify the attributes we want to return from the modified rows.

The OUTPUT clause is designed similarly to the SELECT clause, only you need to prefix
the attributes with either the inserted or deleted keyword. In an INSERT statement, you refer to
inserted; in a DELETE statement, you refer to deleted; and in an UPDATE statement, you refer
to deleted for the old state of the row and inserted for the new state.

The OUTPUT clause returns a result set, much like a SELECT statement does. If you want to
direct the result set to a table, add an INTO clause with the target table name. If you want to
return modified rows back to the caller and also direct a copy to a table, specify two OUTPUT
clauses: one with the INTO clause and one without it.

	INSERT with OUTPUT

This is useful when one needs to insert a row set into a table with an identity column, and
you need to get back all identity values that were generated. SCOPE_IDENTITY only returns the
last value generated-- not all those generated by the statement. OUTPUT clause makes this task
easy to achieve.

-- all newly generated identity values.

INSERT INTO dbo.T1(datacol)
	OUTPUT inserted.datacol, inserted.keycol
	SELECT lastname
	FROM HR.Employees
	WHERE country = 'USA';


/*
We can also direct the result set into a table. When the result set is stored in the 
target table, you can manipulate the data by querying that table.
*/

-- For example, the following code declares a table variable called @NewRows, inserts another 
-- result set into T1, and directs the result set returned by the OUTPUT clause into the table 
-- variable. The code then queries the table variable just to show the data that was stored in it:


DECLARE @NewRows TABLE(keycol INT, datacol NVARCHAR(40));

INSERT INTO dbo.T1(datacol)
	OUTPUT inserted.keycol, inserted.datacol
	INTO @NewRows(keycol, datacol)
		SELECT lastname
		FROM HR.Employees
		WHERE country = 'UK';

SELECT * FROM @NewRows;

-- Lets check table T1

SELECT * FROM dbo.T1;

/*
	DELETE with OUTPUT 

The following code demonstrates the use of OUTPUT clause with a DELETE statement.

	UPDATE with OUTPUT

By using the OUTPUT clause with an UPDATE statement, you can refer to both the state of the
modified row before the change(by prefixing the attribute names with the deleted keyword) and 
to the state after the change(by prefixing the attribute names with the inserted keyword).
This way, you can return both old and new states of the updated attributes.

	MERGE with OUTPUT

You can also use the OUTPUT clause with the MERGE statement, but remember that a single
MERGE statement can invoke multiple different DML actions. To identify which DML action
produced each output row, you can invoke a function called $action in the OUTPUT clause,
which will return a string representing the action (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE).

	Nested DML

The OUTPUT clause returns an output row for every modified row. But what if you need to direct
only a subset of the modified rows to a table, perhaps for auditing purposes. T-SQL supports
a feature called Nested DML-- This allows us to directly insert into the final target table
only subset of rows you need from the full set of modified rows.
