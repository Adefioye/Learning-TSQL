THis is a scalar expression that returns a value based on conditional logic. It is based

action such as controlling the flow of your code. It returns value. Because it is a scalar
expression, it is allowed wherever scalar expressions are allowed such as SELECT, WHERE,
HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses and in CHECK constraints

There are 2 forms of CASE expressions: simple and searched. We use simple to compare one
value/ scalar expression with a list of possible values and return a value for first match.
If no valuein the list CASE expression returns value in then ELSE clause otherwise it 
defaults to ELSE NULL.

The simple CASE form has a single test value that is compared to a list of possible
values. The searched CASE form allows for the use of predicates in the WHEN clause.

T-SQL supports some functions you can consider as abbreviations of the CASE expression:
ISNULL, COALESCE, IIF, and CHOOSE. Note that of the four, only COALESCE is standard.

/*
SQL uses a 3-valued predicate logic. However, it has different meanings in SQL
language elements. This made it impossible to equate 'accept TRUE' and 'reject FALSE'
For example, The treatment SQL has for query filters is 'accept TRUE' while
for CHECK constraint, it 'rejects FALSE'.

SQL treats NULLs inconsistently in different language elements for comparison and sorting purposes.
Some treat 2 NULLs as same while others treat them differently.
For grouping and sorting purposes-- 2 NULLs are considered the same
In ORDER BY: SQL standard leaves this to product implementation. It can either come before
or after values. However, it must be consistent within the implementation. T-SQL sorts NULLs
before present values

For the purposes of ensuring a UNIQUE constraint, standard SQL treats NULLs as different 
from each other(thereby allowing multiple NULLs). Conversely, in T-SQL, a UNIQUE constraint 
considers 2 NULLs as equal(allowing only one NULL).

/*	OPERATORS and FUNCTIONS	

This section covers string concatenation and functions that operate on character strings.
For string concatenation, T-SQL provides (+) operator and the CONCAT function.
For other operations on character strings, T-SQL provides several functions including
SUBSTRING, LEFT, RIGHT, LEN, DATALENGTH, CHARINDEX, PATINDEX, REPLACE, REPLICATE
STUFF, UPPER, LOWER, RTRIM, LTRIM, FORMAT, COMPRESS, DECOMPRESS and STRING_SPLIT.

It is important to note that there is no SQL standard functions library-- They are all
implementation specific*/

SELECT empid, firstname + ' ' + lastname AS full_name

/*To treat a NULL as an empty string-- or more accurately to replace the NULL with an empty

We can revise the query above to avoid SQL Server retuirning NULL*/

*/

/* SUBSTRING function

Syntax: SUBSTRING(string, start, length)

If the length argument exceeds the character length, the function returns everything 
without raising an error

LEFT and RIGHT functions

Syntax: LEFT(string, n), RIGHT(string, n)

LEFT and RIGHT functions are abbreviations of SUBSTRING function. They return 'n' number of
characters from left to right of the string

/*	
	LEN and DATALENGTH function	

LEN-- This gives number of characters in input string
DATALENGTH-- This gives number of bytes in input string

For regular characters, LEN and DATALENGTH returns same number because 1char = 1byte
For Unicode characters, LEN and DATALENGTH returns different numbers because 1char >= 2bytes

Note: Another important distinction between the two is that LEN excludes trailing spaces.
Meanwhile, DATALENGTH does not leave out trailing spaces.

	CHARINDEX function

This returns the position of a substring in a string

CHARINDEX(substring, string, start_pos) 

start_pos is an optional argument that tells the function where to start looking. If substring is
not found, function returns 0.

	PATINDEX function

This returns the position of the first occurence of a pattern within a string. The example 
below shows hwo to find the position of the first occurence of a digit in a string.
	REPLACE function
This replaces all occurence of a substring1 in string with substring2

Syntax: REPLACE(string, substring1, substring2)

	REPLICATE function
This replicates a string a certin number of times.

Syntax: REPLICATE(string, n)-- This repeats string 'n' number of times

	STUFF function
This replaces a substring with another string 

Syntax: STUFF(string, pos, delete_length, insert_string)

	RTRIM and LTRIM function
This removes leading and trailing spaces of an input string

	FORMAT function
This format an input value as a charcater string based on MIcrosoft .NET format string 
and an optional culture specification.

Syntax: FORMAT(input, format_string, culture)..

Generally, we should refrain from using it because of performance issue

	COMPRESS and DECOMPRESS functions
The COMPRESS and DECOMPRESS functions use the GZIP algorithm to compress and
decompress the input, respectively. Both functions were introduced in SQL Server 2016.

	STRING_SPLIT function
The STRING_SPLIT table function splits an input string with a separated list of values into the
individual elements. This function was introduced in SQL Server 2016.

/*	DATE and TIME data types
First, there are 2 legacy date and time dsta types. Example DATETIME and SMALLDATETIME.
There are now 4 more additions post-2008 SQL Server. Example, DATE, TIME, DATETIME2 and
DATETIMEOFFSET. 

It is important to note that DATE and TIME data types provide a separartion between the
date and time components if you need it. DATETIME2 has a bigger date range and precision
than the legacy types. DATETIMEOFFSET also includes offset from UTC. 

Of note is that, TIME, DATETIME2 and DATETIMEOFFSET depend on the precision chosen. Thne precsion 
is usually represented as integers between 0-7. 

TIME(0) -- connotes precision at fractional-second.
TIME(3) -- connotes precision at one-millisecond.
TIME(7) -- connotes precision at 100-nanosecond.

T-SQL does not have a way of to represent date and time literal. Instead there is an implicit
conversion of one data type to the other based on data-type precedence.

To change overall default language in your session, use SET LANGUAGE.

TO change date format, use SET DATEFORMAT.

SET LANGUAGE/SET DATEFORMAT are only affecting how SQL server interprets the input string
and not the output of the result.

It is recommended that language-neutral datetime literal is used because of other readers 
from another country /region that wanna look at your code.

literal expressed as 'YYYYMMDD' is not affected by the language settings. and therefore
